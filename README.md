## Demo

to-do


## Further Improvements

Fix:
- [x] remove obstacles as they go outside board
- [ ] prevent player from going outside


Functionality:
- shooting (recommended)
- drop different things (prizes, different types of obstacles...)
- count points
- improve game over
- levels (ex. increasing speed as user moves to the next level)
- multiple lives
- allow moving the player up and down
- random sizes for obstacles

UX:
- add images or textures/gradients (background, player, obstacles...)
- sound

Code quality:
- create a Game class (keeping there all information and functionality related to the game)
- settings (speed of the game, distance between obstacles)
